## Boot Camp Aims

+ Go over TDD in more detail and give you the chance to practice
+ Introduce you to refactoring techniques and practice on existing code
+ Understand why we end up with duplication in code, why this can be a problem and practice improving it

--

### Competencies we aim to cover

+ TDD Kata and description
  + **S1**: create logical and maintainable code
  + **S4**: test code and analyse results to correct errors found using unit testing
  + **S6**: identify and create test scenarios
  + **S7**: apply structured techniques to problem solving, debug code and understand the structure of programmes in order to identify and resolve issues

--

### Competencies we aim to cover (continued)

+ Relating requirements to tests
  + **S9**: create analysis artefacts, such as use cases and/or user stories
+ Refactoring exercises
  + **K7**: Software design approaches and patterns, to identify reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems
  + **S1**: create logical and maintainable code
